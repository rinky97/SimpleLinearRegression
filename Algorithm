Here we use the concept of one independent variable and one dependent variable.
Independent Variable: Years of Experience.
Dependent Variable: Salary

A Linear Regression Model works on the principal of linear dependence via the equation
    y = b0 + b1*(x)
    
    y: dependent variable (Salary)
    b0: constant
    b1: coeffient of x, slope of equation
    x: independent variable (Years of experience)
    
The model aims at obtaining a linear line which can map the given salaries closely, it tries to fit the values by minimising the value of

min((y-y')^2)
where y = actual salary
      y' = the salary obtained by the linear regressor line.
